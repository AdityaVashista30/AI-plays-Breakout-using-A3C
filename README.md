# AI-plays-Breakout-using-A3C
It is Artificial Intelligence project where a computer learns to play Breakout game using A3C model and using environment space from Open AI Gym.

The A3C model is made up of combination of CNN,RNN and ANN layers having 2 outputs. The model have 5 Convulational Layers followed by LSTM (RNN) layer, followed by 2 hidden ANN layers and final two output layers: actor and critic.
The CNN layers are used by AI to visualize the enviornment/game; LSTM is used to keep memory and track of game movements; ANN layers to analyse the situation and predict the suitable outputs.
